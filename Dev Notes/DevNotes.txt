1. If Sass script in package.json ever acts up with folloiwng error message
"{
  "status": 3,
  "message": "File to read not found or unreadable: D:/HTML+CSS+JavaScript+NodeJS_src/ModernPortfolio/scss/main.scss",
  "formatted": "Internal Error: File to read not found or unreadable: D:/HTML+CSS+JavaScript+NodeJS_src/ModernPortfolio/scss/main.scss\n"   
}"
When the .scss folder/file should clearly be visible then just delete node_modules and reinstall node-sass 
(this is the only current fix)
|-> Workaround to this is just use the Live Sass extension for VS code
----------------
POTENTIAL CAUSE: theory is the initial git commit immediately after node-sass is installed displayed a message about crlf being replaced by lf
somewhere, this lf does show up in the error message above. So maybe its git that's doing it?
[DEBUNKED]
PARTIAL SOLUTION:
|->replaced node_modules/node-sass/lib/render.js with this file here: https://github.com/marcosbozzani/node-sass/blob/266861bf5761dcafd5d53d123264b965c861887c/lib/render.js
    |-> except it crashes...ughhh

==> Just going to use Live Sass extension for VS code, it works no bullshit (so far)
